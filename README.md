# sarcoid_RNAseq_analysis

arcoidosis is a multisystem immune-responsive disease that disproportionately affects women and African Americans. It is characterized by the formation of non-infectious granulomas in various organs of the body, including the lungs, eyes, nervous system, heart, liver, and skin. The immune cascade contributes to this granulomatous tissue inflammation. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis provides a powerful approach to elucidate prognostically significant biomarkers. Our current study focuses on comparing cellular heterogeneity and gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in sarcoidosis and healthy subjects. 

Here I am presenting here to describe by following steps. Step1 contains: samples loading, QC metrices, Doublet finding, and Harmonization.
