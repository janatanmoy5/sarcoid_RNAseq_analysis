# sarcoid_RNAseq_analysis

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem immune-responsive disease that disproportionately affects women and African Americans. It is characterized by the formation of non-infectious granulomas in various organs of the body, including the lungs, eyes, nervous system, heart, liver, and skin. The immune cascade contributes to this granulomatous tissue inflammation. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis provides a powerful approach to elucidate prognostically significant biomarkers. Our current study focuses on comparing cellular heterogeneity and gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in sarcoidosis and healthy subjects. 

Here I am presenting here to describe by following steps. 

Step1: scanpy_pbmc_for_sarcoid_step1.html. It contains samples loading, QC metrices, Doublet finding, and Harmonization. 

Step2: scanpy_pbmc_for_sarcoid_step2.html. It cotains clustering analysis.

Step3: scanpy_pbmc_for_sarcoid_step3.html. It cotains Cell cylce scoring and density distribution of all samples.

Step4: scanpy_pbmc_for_sarcoid_step4.html. It cotains Gene expression study, compared with Azimuth cell marker genes and Manual annotation. 

Step5: scanpy_pbmc_for_sarcoid_step5.html. Re-clustering and gene expression study in detailed.
